An Edition is a publication of a Product's documentation.
Editions allow products to have multiple versions of documentation published at once, from separate URLs.
For example, the 'latest' documentation might be published to ``docs.project.org``, but documentation for the tagged 'v1' might be published to ``v1.docs.project.org``.

Editions are merely pointers to a Build; an Edition is updated by pointing to a newer build.
